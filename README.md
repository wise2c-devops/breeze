## Features
* **Easy to run**: Breeze combines all resources you need such as kubernetes components images, ansible playbooks for the deployment of kubernetes clusters into a single docker image (wise2c/playbook). It also works as a local RHEL/CentOS yum and Ubuntu apt repository server. You just need a linux server with docker and docker-compose installed to run Breeze.

* **Simplified the process of kubernetes clusters deployment**: With a few simple commands, you can get Breeze running, and then finish all the other deployment processes by the graphical interface.

* **Support offline deployment**: After 5 images (playbook, yum-repo/apt-source, pagoda, deploy-ui) have been loaded on the deploy server, kubernetes clusters can be setup without internet access. Breeze works as a yum/apt repository server and deploys a local Harbor registry and uses kubeadm to setup kubernetes clusters. All docker images will be pulled from the local Harbor registry. 

* **Support multi-cluster**: Breeze supports multiple kubernetes clusters deployment.

* **Support high available architecture**:  With Breeze, you can setup kubernetes clusters with 3 master servers and 3 etcd servers combined with haproxy and keepalived. All worker nodes will use the virtual floating ip address to communicate with the master servers.

## Architecture

## Components
- **breeze**: Ansible playbook for deployments of docker, harbor, haproxy+keepalived, etcd, kubernetes.

- **yum-repo**: RHEL/CentOS yum repository for docker, docker-compose, kubelet, kubectl, kubeadm, kubernetes-cni etc,. 

- **apt-source**: Ubuntu apt source repository for docker, docker-compose, kubelet, kubectl, kubeadm, kubernetes-cni etc,. 

- **deploy-ui**: Graphical user interface.

- **pagoda**: Server offers the API to operate Ansible playbooks.

- **kubeadm-version**: Get k8s components images version list by command "kubeadm config"

## Install & Run

**System requirements:**

**Deploy server:** docker 1.13.1+ and docker-compose 1.12.0+ .

**Kubernetes cluster server:** CentOS 7.4/7.5/7.6/7.7 or Ubuntu 16/18 is required and minimal installation mode is recommended.
